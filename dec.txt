You will write a program that will first construct a Huffman Tree from a sequence of Characters.  Each leaf at the bottom of the tree will represent just a single Character.  We will allow letters, digits, punctuation, and any other type of Character.Once the Huffman Tree has been built, your program will be able to do two things:tttom of the tree will represent just a single Character.  We will allow letters, digits, punctuation, and any other type of Character.Once the Huffman Tree has been built, your program will be able to do two things:ttts, punctuation, and any other type of Character.Once the Huffman Tree has been built, your program will be able to do two things:
