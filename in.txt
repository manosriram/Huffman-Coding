Each leaf in the tree contains a symbol (in this case a Character) and an integer value.  Each non-leaf (internal node) contains just references to its left and right children.  The 0's and 1's that you see are not stored anywhere, we just mentally associate 0 with any left branch and 1 with any right branch.

Each character that appears in the tree is assigned a unique code (a sequence of 0's and 1's) obtained by following the path from the root of the tree to the leaf containing that character.   Below are the codes for the four characters found in this sample tree:
