Problem Statement: Write a C++ program to create a file using file handling and check whether the file is created successfully or not. If a file is created successfully then it should print “File Created Successfully” otherwise should print some error message.

Approach: orlare a stream class file and open that text file in writing mode. If the file is not present then it creates a new text file. Now check if the file does not exist or not created then return false otherwise return true.
